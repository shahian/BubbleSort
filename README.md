# BubbleSort
Bubble sort is the simplest of all sorting techniques in Java.
This technique sorts the collection by repeatedly comparing two adjacent elements and swapping them if they are not in the desired order.
Thus, at the end of the iteration, the heaviest element gets bubbled up to claim its rightful position.

If there are n elements in list A given by A[0],A[1],A[2],A[3],â€¦.A[n-1], then A[0] is compared to A[1], A[1] is compared to A[2] and so on. 
After comparing if the first element is greater than the second, then the two elements are swapped if they are not in order.
